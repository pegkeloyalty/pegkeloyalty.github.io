For purposes of clarity, these Terms and Conditions are incorporated by reference into the Merchant Agreement executed by you, and, together with the Merchant Agreement and all attachments thereto, govern your use of all Pegke Loyalty Programs and services.</p>

<h2 id="intellectual-property-rights">2. Intellectual Property Rights.</h2>
<p>(i) Pegke Loyalty is the sole and exclusive owner of all right, title and interest in and to any data provided to Pegke Loyalty by your customers or any end user to Pegke Loyalty in connection with the Pegke Loyalty Programs, including without limitation all e-mail and/or other contact information (“Customer Data”). As such, you shall not, unless the applicable customer has separately taken all steps necessary to opt in to provide contact information to you, be provided with or otherwise have access to the Customer Data.</p>

<p>(ii) Pegke Loyalty owns all right, title and interest in and to the Pegke Loyalty Programs (which include, for purposes of clarity, all software and/or mobile applications related thereto) including, without limitation, any intellectual property rights and any improvements, modifications, enhancements or refinements thereto. Except as set forth in the Agreement, all rights not expressly granted to you are reserved. You agree not to decipher, decompile, disassemble, reconstruct, translate, reverse engineer, or discover any of the Pegke Loyalty Programs, intellectual property or ideas, algorithms, file formats, programming, or interoperability interfaces underlying or such intellectual property.</p>

<p>(iii) Pegke Loyalty hereby grants to you a limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable license to access and use Pegke Loyalty’s hosted Merchant Web Portal (the “Portal”) for internal business purposes so long as your account with Pegke Loyalty remains current and active. If Pegke Loyalty provides you with a password to access the Portal, you are solely responsible for protecting the password and for any authorized or unauthorized use made of the password. The Portal, and all source code, object code, software, copyrights and other intellectual property associated therewith, are and shall remain the sole and exclusive property of Pegke Loyalty. You shall refrain from permitting any third party to use your password or otherwise access the Portal. Pegke Loyalty shall have the right to terminate the license granted hereby immediately in the event that you have breached any terms or conditions set forth in the Agreement or your Pegke Loyalty account is otherwise terminated for any reason.</p>

<p>(iv) Without limiting any of Pegke Loyalty’s rights set forth in the Agreement, Pegke Loyalty reserves the right, in its sole discretion but without any obligation on its part, to reject, remove, delete and/or cancel any information or content displayed or posted on any tablet, the Pegke Loyalty website, any portion of the Pegke Loyalty Program, and/or within any print materials, including without limitation any information and/or content that, in Pegke Loyalty’s view, contains content or links which do not meet Pegke Loyalty’s specifications or requirements. In addition, Pegke Loyalty shall be entitled, in its sole discretion and without notice to any party, to redesign and/or modify all or any portion of the Pegke Loyalty Program (including without limitation any mobile application and/or software) at any time.</p>

<h2 id="restrictions">3. Restrictions.</h2>
<p>You: (i) will use the Pegke Loyalty Programs solely for your internal business purposes; and (ii) will not, for yourself, any of your affiliates or any third party (a) sell, rent, lease, license or sublicense, assign, distribute, or transfer the Pegke Loyalty Programs, (b) modify, change, alter, create derivative works of, decipher, decompile, disassemble, reconstruct, translate, reverse engineer, or discover any source code of the underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats, programming, or interoperability interfaces of the Pegke Loyalty Programs, (c) copy any tangible versions of the Pegke Loyalty Programs, or (d) remove from any of the Pegke Loyalty Programs any language or designation indicating the confidential nature thereof or the proprietary rights of Pegke Loyalty. In addition, you will not export, re-export or permit any third party to export or re-export, directly or indirectly, the Pegke Loyalty Programs where such export or re-export is prohibited by applicable law without appropriate licenses and clearances. Pegke Loyalty retains the right, in its sole discretion but without any obligation on the part of Pegke Loyalty to monitor or evaluate any communications, to approve, modify or refuse any Pegke Loyalty-related communications or proposed communications or messages to your customers or any Pegke Loyalty end users.</p>

<h2 id="fees-pricing-and-payment-terms-taxes">4. Fees; Pricing and Payment Terms; Taxes.</h2>
<p>(i) Pegke Loyalty’s current fees for the Pegke Loyalty Programs and its services are set forth in the Merchant Agreement. Pegke Loyalty reserves the right to amend the fees payable for the Pegke Loyalty Programs at any time upon thirty (30) days’ prior notice to you; provided, however, that such amendment to the fees will not be applicable until the beginning of the next Subscription Period.</p>

<p>(ii) When you provide your payment information to Pegke Loyalty, you are providing Pegke Loyalty with an authorization to process any and all payments as outlined in this Agreement. In certain instances, the payment processing may not occur immediately, and your payment may show as “pending” during this time period. In addition, Pegke Loyalty may request an authorization for the amount of your anticipated transaction in advance and may estimate the final value of the transaction, which may be more than the amount of the actual transaction. Pegke Loyalty will release any funds authorized in excess of the amount of the actual transaction at the time the transaction settles.</p>

<p>(iii) You will be responsible for any sales, use, value-added or import taxes, customs duties or similar taxes assessed in accordance with applicable law with respect to the provision of the Pegke Loyalty Programs.</p>

<p>(iv) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Pegke Loyalty, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate the Agreement and corresponding access and right to use all or any portion of the Pegke Loyalty Programs, at any time, upon electronic or other notice to you, if you have not paid all amounts due on or before the payment due date, or for any other breaches of the Merchant Agreement, these Terms and Conditions, or any other exhibits, addenda or attachments to these Terms and Conditions including any links contained in the Merchant Agreement or these Terms and Conditions, which are incorporated by reference herein. You are responsible for amounts that remain outstanding as of the date of such termination including early cancellation fees. You agree to pay reasonable attorneys’ fees and court costs incurred by Pegke Loyalty to collect any unpaid amounts owed by you.</p>

<p>(v) Pegke Loyalty will repair or replace damaged tablets due to normal wear and year or any hardware/software malfunction at no cost to any merchant in good standing. A merchant in good standing is primarily defined as having no outstanding balance due to Pegke Loyalty, but may be defined by other criteria as specified by Pegke Loyalty.</p>

<p>(vi) Should your Merchant Agreement indicate a seasonal term, your contract will be extended by the number of months which billing is paused for seasonality, as indicated on the Agreement. All Pegke Loyalty equipment will remain the responsibility of the merchant during entire term of the Agreement.</p>

<h2 id="term-termination-survival">5. Term; Termination; Survival.</h2>
<p>The Pegke Loyalty solution term, as further described below, is effective upon the earlier of the arrival date or estimated arrival date of the solution as stated within the Merchant Agreement. All other subsequent changes or modifications to the merchant agreement are effective upon the completion of the merchant purchase order. You may amend your contract to include additional Pegke Loyalty features through your Web Command Center. When you make changes through your Web Command Center, you are providing explicit authorization for Pegke Loyalty to process payment on your existing Pegke Loyalty account and method of payment without any further authorization necessary from you.</p>

<p>The Agreement will remain in full force specified in the Merchant Agreement. At the end of any Subscription Plan, unless you select a new Subscription Plan, your Subscription Plan will automatically renew on a month–to–month Subscription Plan at the then-current rates. Effective January 1, 2015, new agreements and/or subscriptions may automatically renew for successive 1-year terms upon expiration of the initial term of any Subscription Plan at the then-current standard rates until such time as either party provides written notice of termination to the other party, in accordance with terms below. Current fees will be charged to the payment method on file unless Pegke Loyalty is otherwise notified of a cancellation in writing. Although Pegke Loyalty may choose to send a reminder email prior to charging a customer for a renewal fee, Pegke Loyalty is not responsible for notifying a customer of this automated renewal.</p>

<p>A merchant may cancel its subscription, thereby terminating this Agreement, solely in accordance with the following cancellation policies:</p>

<p>Money Back Guarantee – If your Merchant Agreement specifies that you are entitled to a “30 day Money Back Guarantee” you shall, by providing written termination notice to Pegke Loyalty within thirty (30) days of the Installation Date, be entitled to have the Pegke Loyalty Kit uninstalled. In order to qualify for your Money–Back–Guarantee, we simply require that you speak to your Merchant Success Manager to set up your program and enroll a minimum of 5 customers during the Money–Back–Guarantee period. If you do not meet these qualifications you will be charged a restocking fee of $50 upon cancellation. Within thirty (30) days of Pegke Loyalty’s receipt of the Pegke Loyalty Kit, Pegke Loyalty will refund you any money collected for the initial monthly subscription fee in the same manner in which the initial fee was paid. All Onboarding, Activation, or Setup fees are non-refundable. If, after thirty (30) days from the Installation Date and prior to the subsequent Subscription Period, you desire to terminate the Pegke Loyalty Program, you agree to pay an early cancellation fee equal to six (6) months of your monthly subscription fee, as well as a $50 restocking fee via the credit card or ACH on file with Pegke Loyalty. If you subscribe to a variable subscription fee plan, your early cancellation fee is equal to (6) months at the most recent monthly billed rate along with a $50 restocking fee.</p>

<p>Renewal – At the end of any Subscription Plan, unless you select a new Subscription plan, your Subscription Plan will automatically be renewed on an annual or monthly (as applicable) basis at the then-current standard rates. Current fees will be charged to the credit card or ACH on file unless Pegke Loyalty is otherwise notified of a cancellation in writing. Customers renewed on a monthly basis must provide written cancellation notice at least sixty (60) days prior to the beginning of the next monthly or annual term (as applicable). Customers renewed on an annual basis must provide written cancellation notice sixty (60) days prior to or within the first thirty (30) days of their renewal period. Although Pegke Loyalty may choose to send a reminder email prior to charging a customer for a renewal fee, Pegke Loyalty is not responsible for notifying a customer of this automated renewal.</p>

<p>Subscription Cancellation within the Contract Term – Customers enrolled in Monthly or Annual subscription plans shall provide at least sixty (60) days’ written cancellation notice. If, prior to the subsequent Subscription Period, you desire to terminate the Pegke Loyalty Program, You agree to pay an early cancellation fee equal to six (6) months of your monthly subscription fee, as well as a $50 restocking fee via the credit card or ACH on file with Pegke Loyalty. If you subscribe to a variable subscription fee plan, your early cancellation fee is equal to six (6) months at the most recent monthly billed rate along with a $50 restocking fee. You will not be entitled to any refund of any pre-paid or prior subscription payments.</p>

<p>Other Events – Each party shall have the right to terminate the Agreement upon written notice to the other party: (i) upon the institution of insolvency, receivership or bankruptcy proceedings or any other proceedings for the settlement of debts of the other party that is not otherwise dismissed within sixty (60) days of such institution; (ii) upon the making of an assignment for the benefit of creditors by the other party; or (iii) upon the dissolution of the other party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Pegke Loyalty may terminate the Agreement and/or your access to one or all Pegke Loyalty Programs in the event you fail to remain current in all fees due and owing to Pegke Loyalty or in the event you breach any of your obligations under the Agreement. Pegke Loyalty will cease to collect the monthly subscription fee at the point in time in which Pegke Loyalty has received your returned Pegke Loyalty Kit.</p>

<p>In the event of any termination of the Agreement or any Pegke Loyalty Program, Pegke Loyalty shall be entitled to send e-mail and/or other communications to some or all of your loyalty program members, notifying each such member of your termination of the Pegke Loyalty Program. In addition to the foregoing permissible e-mail, Pegke Loyalty shall be entitled to take other actions, at its discretion, to assist your loyalty program members in protecting the points earned within the Pegke Loyalty Program and providing them an opportunity to redeem points earned.</p>

<p>In addition, all items in the Pegke Loyalty Kit must be returned to Pegke Loyalty in specified return packaging provided by Pegke Loyalty. If you were not previously provided with specified return packaging, Pegke Loyalty will provide you with specified return packaging at no cost to you, otherwise you will be charged for packaging materials. You are responsible for all return shipping charges and for any damage incurred in the shipping process. If any item in the Pegke Loyalty Kit is not returned, Pegke Loyalty will charge you for the cost of the item not returned. Pegke Loyalty will prorate the last monthly subscription fee based on the date the Pegke Loyalty Kit is received by Pegke Loyalty. You may be required to fill out an exit survey in order to complete any cancellation request. Pegke Loyalty may refuse to accept the return of its equipment until the exit survey is completed. If You do not complete the exit survey in a timely fashion, You may be charged a fee for missing equipment until the exit survey is completed. Any provision of the Agreement which contemplates performance or observance subsequent to any termination or expiration of the Agreement shall survive any termination or expiration of the Agreement and continue in full force and effect.
